# Yup, Just Buildings

I have been deeply interested in the model based controls space of buildings ever since doing my MS in ArchEng under [Gregor Henze](https://www.colorado.edu/faculty/henze/) at CU Boulder. After completing grad school, I realized that the building controls in the real world are quite outdated. Model based control of buildings is still extremely niche, ultimately coming down to usability, scalability, and workflow patterns in the AEC world. I think of buildings as the largest deployed grid-tied battery asset in the world - if only we could drastically scale, simplify, and improve their controls. I often get confused looks when I attempt to describe what I do to folks, followed by something along the lines of "But, you're just working on buildings, right?", to which I stutteringly respond with "Well, ya see, I mean...yeah, exactly, just buildings".

My main goals are to contribute to decarbonization efforts and become the best engineer I can be across a broad range of disciplines - software, controls, thermal fluid systems and simulation, and electro-mechanical engineering. This website is intended to be a resource for myself and others. I'm excited to post about my personal and professional endeavors.
